									<h2><center> EE - 538 Principles of Modern Digital Communication </center></h2>
									<p>
										Communication in simple words can be defined as an act of exchange
										of information. From using pigeons for delivering messages, to the
										advent of 5G/ 6G networks, there had been several advancements made
										for this evolution to take place. From time to time, engineers, and
										researchers from all around the world have collaborated in defining
										cellular standards and realized the dream of making this world a single
										connected place!
									</p>
									<p>
										Currently, we are witnessing the 5th Generation technology standard
										for cellular networks. I still remember the 2.5th Generation back in my
										home country India, when I connected to the Internet for the first time
										through GPRS/ EDGE technology. I was thrilled to explore the world
										of the internet with 100-150 Kbps of speed and it felt magical. Fast
										forward to today, we can browse the internet with a peak speed of 20
										Gbps. As each decade passed, we were able to witness a new generation
										of cellular standards and this was possible due to the research and
										development in Digital Communication.

									</p>
									<p>
										The Modern Digital Communication course introduced us to the basic
										principles that are necessary to design a digital communication system.
										Instructor Dr. Su taught us various modulation schemes, transmitter
										design, channel models as well as receiver design. The Professor would
										actively ask questions throughout the lectures and ignited a spark of
										curiosity in us. I liked these discussions because they enhanced my
										critical thinking and intrigued me. The Professor always welcomed to 
										ask any doubts regarding the subject and appreciated it. Assignments 
										were given periodically, which helped us to get a better grip on the
										subject.
									</p>
									<p>
										We simulated a digital communication system in MATLAB, to analyze
										the performance of 3 modulation schemes as the final project for this
										course. The three modulation schemes used were Binary Pulse
										Amplitude Modulation (B-PAM), 4-PAM, and 4-Quadrature
										amplitude modulation (QAM). We compared the simulation results
										with the theoretical performance of the modulation schemes and
										collated the performance of three modulation schemes with each other.
										This project was insightful as we were able to visualize various
										concepts that were discussed in the class. 
                                        A few of the graphs from the simulation are shown below:

									</p>
									<p>
										There is a saying that you should experiment with your 20s. I was
										experimenting with various fields and exploring new domains since my
										undergraduate days. But after coming to the USA to pursue my
										Masterâ€™s, I decided to make a career in the field of communication as
										it fascinated me and this course helped me to lay a strong foundation
										from which I can further excel. I would strongly recommend any
										student who is interested in communication to take EE 538.

									<h2><center> EE 701 - Internet of Things </center></h2>
									<p>
										Internet of Things is the buzz phrase that has been around for a while 
										and will continue to be for some time. So what is this? Why do people
										make such a big fuss over IoT? The “Thing” in the IoT can be anything
										from an image sensor, to an irrigation system, to a cargo container 
										having a temperature sensor that sends the data to the logistics 
										coordinator. Anything that senses its surrounding environment and
										can communicate over the internet is called a Thing and the Internet 
										of Things is a network, where these Things can connect as well as
										exchange data. A study predicts that by 2025, there will be 41.6 billion
										IoT devices worldwide!
									</p>													
									<p>
										Internet of Things instructed by Dr. Guan was a unique course that I
										took in my graduate program. It is unique because, in tandem with
										regular classes, there were lab sessions and literature review
										assignments. The course was specialized for final semester students to
										have an overall educational experience. Through the classes, Dr. Guan
										gave us an introduction to three significant Low Power Wide Area
										Network (LPWAN) technologies which were LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Lora is a non-cellular modulation technology used by LoRaWAN.
										Sigfox is a proprietary owned network operator that builds wireless
										networks to connect low-power objects transmitting small amounts of
										data. NB-IoT is a 3GPP initiative developed to enable a wide range of
										new IoT devices and services. The objective of NB-IoT, which is a
										cellular standard, is to standardize IoT devices so that they are stable
										and interoperable. All of these technologies helped me to have a
										pragmatic view of IoT.
									</p>
									<p>
										Dr. Guan is very amicable and instructs topics in an intuitive approach.
										Some aspects of this course can be traced back to EE 534 instructed by
										Dr. Guan himself and the fundaments of EE 534 helped me to have a
										better outlook of EE 701. The classes were usually non-rigid with
										active discussions. Professor would intrigue us with questions and
										acknowledge our doubts. The assignments were not usual writing or
										solving problems. They were paper reading assignments where we did
										a literature review of interesting IEEE research papers and presented
										in class. Many such differentiating factors made this course stand out 
										from other coursework.
									</p>
									<p>
										For the project in EE 701, we were given options to build an
										independent project or else to work in Wireless Networking and
										Systems (WINGS) lab and assist the Ph.D. students in their research.
										Given the choice, I opted for the latter and had an opportunity to work
										on the srsRAN project where we tried to implement a 4G LTE network
										on top of an Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV). The main goal of this
										project was to deploy our LTE network over multiple UAVs to
										establish cellular communication in remote areas, where it is hard to 
										implement physical base stations. The project demanded a thorough
										understanding of the 4G LTE network which gave us practical 
										exposure to cellular networks. We established wireless 
										communication between eNodeB and EPC and made configurations to
										connect multiple eNBs to a single EPC. Also, experiments were 
										carried out to utilize mmWave routers for connecting EPC with 
										eNodeB. Below are some of the screenshots from our project:

										EE 701 provided us a fun way to explore the Internet of Things. The
										Professor and Teaching Assistant guided us throughout the course on
										having practical knowledge of the coursework. We had seminars by
										experts and researchers who gave us a good exposure to both industry
										expectation and research opportunities. Additionally, fascinating 
										experiments were carried out in class utilizing USRP and the GNU 
										Radio Companion program where we developed modules for absolute 
										function and square function. Needless to say, this was an interesting
										course where we learned concepts, implemented them in the labs, and
										also took part in research projects.

									<h2><center>EE 598 - Individual Problem</center></h2>
									<p > 
										Individual Problem is an intriguing course option offered by the UB
										curriculum where students can take part in research projects under the
										guidance of professors. What a great concept! As soon as I learned
										about this opportunity, I sent Dr. Filippo Malandra, one of my
										professors whom I admire and wanted to work with, a cold email to see
										if there were any projects I might participate in to gain some research
										experience. After a week, Dr. Malandra finally offered to discuss my
										interests and guided me to choose one of several fascinating ongoing
										projects to work on. That is how my work with Dr. Malandra began in
										the Fall 2021.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was delighted to be a part of a research project. We developed an
										LTE-enabled Micro Phasor Measurement Unit(μPMU) and tried to
										analyze the performance of the Narrow Band IoT network. A phasor
										Measurement Unit (PMU) is a device that estimates the magnitude and
										phase of an electrical quantity in an electricity grid using a common
										time source for synchronization. PMU enables real-time monitoring of
										an electrical grid and helps in detecting disturbances in the power grid.
										A Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) was deployed which aggregates the
										phasor data streamed from multiple PMUs for enhanced post-event
										analysis.
									</p>
									<p>
										In our project, we developed a low-cost, low-complex μPMU using an
										ARM cortex microcontroller. Network Time Protocol was used for the
										time synchronization across the system. Several μPMU's were
										deployed and each one relayed its phasor data along with a timestamp
										to the PDC through User Datagram Protocol. PDC was placed on a
										Linux system using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service. Multiple
										tests were conducted simultaneously for the delay analysis. Based on
										the difference between the phasor's timestamp and the arrival time at
										PDC, we examined the delay involved in the network. We were able to
										achieve a delay of less than 200ms. We carried out some post-processing 
										at PDC to calculate Inter-arrival delay and plotted
										histograms. Below are some of the pictures from the analysis:

										Individual problem introduced me to the realm of research at the
										University at Buffalo. We worked in a team and had constant feedback
										from the Professor. We learned to work as a cohesive unit and to
										collaborate in accomplishing the tasks. There were some disagreements
										among the team members that were resolved by discussing viewpoints
										and taking action to find common ground. I am glad that I took this
										course and would suggest everyone make use of this wonderful
										prospect that the University is offering.

									<h2><center> EE - 538 Principles of Modern Digital Communication </center></h2>
									<p>
										Communication in simple words can be defined as an act of exchange
										of information. From using pigeons for delivering messages, to the
										advent of 5G/ 6G networks, there had been several advancements made
										for this evolution to take place. From time to time, engineers, and
										researchers from all around the world have collaborated in defining
										cellular standards and realized the dream of making this world a single
										connected place!

									<h2><center> EE 620 - MIMO Wireless Communication </center></h2>
									<p>
										MIMO is an incredible technology. Ever wonder why the number of
										antennas in the home router got increased? How do multiple antennas 
										increase the data rates? The answer to all of these questions lies in
										MIMO. MIMO stands for Multiple Input Multiple Output. MIMO is
										one of the reasons how we achieve a blazingly fast internet connection 
										and stream 1080p HDTV with bare minimum latency. MIMO was
										initially introduced for Wi-Fi systems and now it is used in both Wi-Fi 
										and Cellular standards. Through MIMO, multiple antennas are
										deployed at both transmitter and receiver which enhances the
										throughput due to the spatial diversity.

									<h2><center>EE 598 - Individual Problem </center></h2>
									<p>
										Individual Problem is an intriguing course option offered by the UB
										curriculum where students can take part in research projects under the
										guidance of professors. What a great concept! As soon as I learned
										about this opportunity, I sent Dr. Filippo Malandra, one of my
										professors whom I admire and wanted to work with, a cold email to see
										if there were any projects I might participate in to gain some research
										experience. After a week, Dr. Malandra finally offered to discuss my
										interests and guided me to choose one of several fascinating ongoing
										projects to work on. That is how my work with Dr. Malandra began in
										the Fall 2021.

									<h2><center> EE 701 - Internet of Things </center></h2>
									<p>
										Internet of Things is the buzz phrase that has been around for a while 
										and will continue to be for some time. So what is this? Why do people
										make such a big fuss over IoT? The “Thing” in the IoT can be anything
										from an image sensor, to an irrigation system, to a cargo container 
										having a temperature sensor that sends the data to the logistics 
										coordinator. Anything that senses its surrounding environment and
										can communicate over the internet is called a Thing and the Internet 
										of Things is a network, where these Things can connect as well as
										exchange data. A study predicts that by 2025, there will be 41.6 billion
										IoT devices worldwide!

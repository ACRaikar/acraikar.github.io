									<h2><center> EE 620 - MIMO Wireless Communication </center></h2>
									<p>
										MIMO is an incredible technology. Ever wonder why the number of
										antennas in the home router got increased? How do multiple antennas 
										increase the data rates? The answer to all of these questions lies in
										MIMO. MIMO stands for Multiple Input Multiple Output. MIMO is
										one of the reasons how we achieve a blazingly fast internet connection 
										and stream 1080p HDTV with bare minimum latency. MIMO was
										initially introduced for Wi-Fi systems and now it is used in both Wi-Fi 
										and Cellular standards. Through MIMO, multiple antennas are
										deployed at both transmitter and receiver which enhances the
										throughput due to the spatial diversity.
									</p>

										MIMO is one of the challenging courses that I took in my graduate
										coursework. As I learned the fundamentals of digital communication
										from EE 538, I was eager to enroll in this course which was a
										continuation of the former. A brief introduction to various cellular
										generations and wifi standards was discussed in the initial classes.
										Later, the RF signal propagation model with a focus on Path Loss,
										Multipath Fading, and Shadowing was introduced. We also got to know
										about various channel fading models and popular ST modulation
										techniques which helped us to gain a sense of why MIMO is important
										and how it can be implemented. At the end of the coursework, we
										realized maximum achievable diversity of MIMO-OFDM systems and
										comprehended the applications of MIMO techniques. The course was
										detail-oriented with mathematical equations and it helped us to attain
										practicality along with an intuitive understanding of the subject.
									</p>
									<p>
										Assignments for the coursework were MATLAB simulations. These
										simulations introspected our understanding of the concepts that were
										discussed in the class. Several hours were spent on completing the
										assignments by constantly revisiting lecture notes and this only further
										strengthened my understanding of the subject. For some assignments, I
										collaborated with fellow students to brainstorm the concepts involved
										and we collectively tried to improve our understanding of the topic.
										Looking back, I feel that all those hours I put into this subject gave me
										a better perspective on wireless systems. I have attached some of the
										simulations from the MATLAB assignments below:

										MIMO is an essential course if anyone is interested in pursuing a career
										in Wireless Communication domain. That being said, the course is
										interesting in various aspects and acts as a basis for many existing and
										upcoming technologies. MIMO plays a substantial role in influencing
										how users interact with the modern telecom network enabling high
										network capacity, better coverage and better user experience. I have no
										doubt that this course will prove beneficial for my career.
